# Indexed Data Transfer Protocol (IDTP)

## Introduction

The **Indexed Data Transfer Protocol (IDTP)** introduces a new paradigm for IoT data management by organizing system information as a set of uniquely indexed variables, enabling precise and efficient read/write operations. Unlike traditional transmission-focused protocols, IDTP emphasizes persistence and reliability by maintaining the latest state of each variable and instantly synchronizing updates across all connected devices. This indexed, modular approach ensures real-time communication, minimizes unnecessary data transfer, and provides robust scalability for complex IoT ecosystems.

## Protocol Overview

IDTP is based on reading and writing a set of system variables, where each variable is uniquely identified by an index.

Formally, the system is defined as:

$$
V = \\{V_0, V_1, V_2, ..., V_n\\}
$$

Where **V** is a set of variables arranged as a matrix of *N* columns and 1 row, with indices starting at 0. Each variable has an assigned data type, which can vary depending on the access mode configured on the server. Variables can be linked to one or more devices that depend on them, enabling efficient system management and control. Whenever a variable value is updated, the new value is instantly transmitted to all dependent devices. Clients receive updates for all variables in real time, ensuring complete system synchronization.
